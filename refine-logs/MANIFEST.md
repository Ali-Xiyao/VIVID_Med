# BiVES-CXR Candidate Rescue Planning Manifest

**Status:** STOPPED_R002_GEOMETRY_FAIL
**Created:** 2026-07-18
**Base commit:** `7c3e7ed`
**Parent authority:** `../BiVES_CXR_MIA_TMI_ready_proposal.md`

This manifest registers the accepted candidate authority and its CPU-only
R001/R002 execution. R002 failed its geometry survival gate, so it does not
authorize model loading, training, VinDr-test reuse, Qwen3.5-4B/9B scaling,
server execution, or a new clinical claim.

## Review gate

- R001 is complete-pass; R002 is complete-fail-hard-stop; R003 onward did not
  run or remain dependency/data blocked.
- VinDr test remains frozen as a diagnostic-only surface after E10.
- VinDr train may support image-disjoint development only; the public DICOMs
  expose no patient, study, or series identifier.
- An independent patient-grouped final dataset remains unavailable.
- A new continuation requires a separately reviewed control-family authority;
  it cannot lower the 90% threshold or reuse VinDr test for selection.

## New connected-control candidate (not yet accepted)

The stopped R001/R002 package above remains immutable. A separate candidate
authority now defines an exact-area, target-disjoint, 4-connected control from
the same coarse content-coordinate zone. It explicitly weakens exact
target-shape matching and does not call the coordinate bins true anatomy.

This candidate does not authorize implementation or execution. It requires an
explicit user acceptance after review. If accepted, C001 is recorded first and
C1/C2 remain CPU-only, model-free dependency gates.
