## Active model boundary

The active family is Qwen3.5 multimodal only:

- 2B for P0/debug;
- 4B for the main model;
- 9B for scale validation;
- 0.8B for optional ultra-light smoke.

No active config may reference Qwen3-VL, Qwen2.5, InternVL, LLaDA, Gemma, or
other prior model families.

## Legacy boundary

`../legacy/vsl_cxr/` preserves the prior VSL-CXR, CEQ, CCSH, AUCH, SAMEQ,
CVCP, case-study, Qwen3-VL, and old external-evaluation implementation.

`../legacy/vivid_med/` preserves pre-BiVES VIVID-Med scripts, models, training,
evaluation, loaders, configs, profiles, prompts, and external tools.

`../legacy/delete_archive/` preserves the small retired root-level cleanup
bundle that previously remained under `delete/`, including old Qwen2.5-era
configs and utility scripts.

Historical result files under ignored `outputs/` remain untouched. They are
pilot/provenance evidence only and cannot close a BiVES paper gate.

## Current execution status

The repository has an executable BiVES core, strict same-statement group
training, mask-before-contextual-block exact-K interventional closure, full-row
primary evaluation, a separate grouped mechanism evaluator, best-checkpoint
selection, decoder-temperature calibration, a vision-only Qwen3.5 loader,
synthetic CPU smoke, and proposal-level unit tests.

Formal training has not been started by this consolidation. Before server P0:

1. create locked train/validation/calibration/test manifests with provenance,
   hashes, complete S/C/U/I groups, and pass the strict mandatory audit;
2. perform the uncertain-vs-insufficient expert pilot;
3. verify same-statement cross-state coverage;
4. run Qwen3.5-2B P0;
5. unlock Qwen3.5-4B only after the proposal go/no-go gates pass.
